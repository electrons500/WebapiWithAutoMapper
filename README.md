# AutoMapper
AutoMapper is a simple library that helps us to transform one object type into another. It is a convention-based object-to-object mapper that requires very little configuration. 

The object-to-object mapping works by transforming an input object of one type into an output object of a different type.

# One Use Case
AutoMapper was built to solve a complex problem that most developers face in their day-to-day life – writing code that maps one object type to another. This type of code is rather tedious and boring to write, so why not leave that job to this little tool?

What makes AutoMapper interesting is that it provides some easy-to-use conventions to take the dirty work out of figuring out how to map Type A to Type B. As long as Type B follows AutoMapper’s established conventions, almost no configuration is needed to map two types.
